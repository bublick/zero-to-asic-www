Tiny Tapeout 9 closed with 95% utilisation! Look at this beauty!

You can download the [full resolution image here](https://github.com/TinyTapeout/tinytapeout-chip-renders/blob/main/shuttles/tt09/full_gds.png).

TT09 was our best ever run, with 369 designs submitted from 21 countries.

Among the digital projects we had an Atari 2600 (with games), a wide range of CPUs and even some SDR projects.

On the analog side we had PLLs, opamps, ADCs, DACs and time to digital converters.

For all the projects, check the [chip's page](https://tinytapeout.com/runs/tt09).
I printed the datasheet, and it's hefty! Download it [here](https://tinytapeout.github.io/tinytapeout-09/datasheet.pdf).

## Leaving it to the last minute

As usual, we got most of the submissions in the last few weeks.

This was in part due to some very successful workshops we ran in the US, with over 250 people in attendance.

[Tiny Tapeout 10](https://tinytapeout.com) is already open and will close in early March 2024.

## Loving the tapeout!

Here's a small selection of feedback we received about Tiny Tapeout:

* "I was able to submit a simple R2R with all open source tools.  What is great about the project and the opensource ecosystem, is that students can understand everything about the project." - David Parent
* "I love you, guys. This is such a cool initiative"
* "Tiny Tapeout is fantastic! Really well done CI backend" - James Sharp
* "Tiny Tapeout is awesome. I'm glad to see the process moving to other processes. Tiny Tapeout is instrumental in improving VLSI education for both hobbyists and professionals."
* "Tiny Tapeout is an excellent way to get involved with silicon. Whether you are an amateur or professional, I believe our community is growing and adding valuable documentation for the open source workflow of ASIC design. Each project we can get submitted makes it easier for prospective designers to use the tools and reach out for help." - Brandon Ramos
