I am excited to introduce a grant for the Zero to ASIC course.

The grant will provide a [Silicon-level ticket](/#tickets) for selected participants. Two grants will be awarded per month.

## Course goals

This course aims to revolutionize open-source silicon by training engineers, hobbyists and enthusiasts to make their own ASICs. During the course, you will design a circuit that will be submitted to the Google lottery MPW to be manufactured in silicon!

## Participation Requirements

* Submitting a design for tapeout: the course is focused on helping participants make their own ASICs. You should aim to submit your design for tapeout, no matter how simple!
* Time investment: The expectation is that you'll spend ~4 hours per week on the course over 8-10 weeks (depending on prior experience)
* Computer access: You'll need a computer with either: Linux and 10 GB free space; Windows at 40 GB free space; internet connection fast enough for voice calls.
* Brief presentation at the monthly meeting: You will need to commit to regularly attending a monthly meeting with other grant participants. At one meeting, you will make a short presentation (~10 min) about your design.
* Letter of Recommendation (optional): Please have a co-worker, professor, friend from a makerspace, or someone else who can comment about you write a brief (1 page maximum) letter about your work and motivation. This letter is optional and can only strengthen your application.
* Minimum ticket price:  The grant will reduce the price to a level that you’re comfortable paying for the value that you’ll receive. The minimum cost is $50 USD.
