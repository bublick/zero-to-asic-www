**Applications for the grant is now closed.**

It's become a cliche, but hardware is hard!
One reason why hardware is harder than software is that the time between revisions is often longer. We need to wait for new PCBs, or for components to be delivered. Or for more new PCBs after we realise we got it wrong!

Another reason is that it can be expensive, and not just for the physical components. We generally need more of a lab than software developers. Not just soldering irons and good lighting. **Test gear** is essential for learning how your circuit is actually behaving, matching simulation to the real world. And it's usually expensive.

I struggled with the cost of hardware development for years, and when someone donated me my first oscilloscope it was a big deal! Seeing the waveforms really helped me to advance my understanding and the complexity of the projects I could undertake.

To help others progress, I'm going to award several Christmas test gear grants. If you're interested, please carefully read the following and apply with the link at the bottom of the page.

# Test equipment

The grant is not for components or development boards. I'm expecting things like:

* Bus pirate
* Tigard
* Digilent Analog discovery
* Analog devices ADALM-PLUTO
* Glasgow interface explorer
* Saleae logic analysers (you can also apply for their [discount](https://blog.saleae.com/saleae-discounts/))
* Power supplies
* Signal generators

# Limitations

* Apply for up to $280 (USD)
* You have to cover at least 25% of the gear yourself
* One application per person

# Grant process

1. Apply for the grant
2. If successful, I will make a test transfer of $5
3. You will purchase the equipment yourself
4. Send me the receipt
5. Once it arrives, send me a photo of it in use
6. I will transfer the balance

# Apply now!
